SHAPE DESIGN
============
Draw a single shape and apply the gradient fill that all shape icons have.
Duplicate the shape three times, move one copy aside and resize another one to be 1px smaller than the original.
Then create the boolean difference between both shapes that weren't moved.
The inner border is done the same way.
Both have 40% opacity and the gradients go from the bottom of the bottom pixel of a shape to the top of of the top one.
