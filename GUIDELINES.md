GENERAL GUIDELINES
------------------
* Large icons should cover at most 22x22px. Always leave at least 1px empty on each side.
* Align to a 1px-grid whenever possible. (Make sure the grid [#] and snapping [%] is on in Inkscape.)
* NEVER use the same symbol to mean two different things. Never use an icon from another icon set to mean something different than it means in that icon set.

TANGO GUIDELINES
----------------
* Put tango icons under the "tango" layer.
* Except for the "save" symbol, always use symbols from https://github.com/GNOME/adwaita-icon-theme rather than custom ones.
* Design icons to have the same style as the full-color Gnome icons.
* Other than that, refer to the Tango icon guidelines: http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Theme_Guidelines .

SYMBOLIC GUIDELINES
-------------------
* Put symbolic icons under the "symbolic" layer.
* Except for the "save" symbol, always use symbols from https://github.com/GNOME/adwaita-icon-theme rather than custom ones.
* Except for color-dependent metaphors, use the same metaphors as the Tango theme uses.
* Use only the color #555753 at either 100% or 30% opacity.
